 Closures and Currying in Ruby
These are powerful functional programming tools in Ruby that take Procs and Lambdas to the next level. Understanding them helps you write flexible, elegant, and highly reusable code — a must for Rails and real-world Ruby.

What is a Closure in Ruby?
A closure is a block of code (like a proc/lambda) that remembers the variables from the scope it was defined in — even if that scope is gone.


✅ Summary:
Concept 	Key Idea
Closure 	Function remembers outer variables
Currying	Function receives args one-by-one
