# Advanced Enumerable
# Convert array of hashes:

# ruby
# Copy
# Edit
# people = [{name: "Alice"}, {name: "Bob"}, {name: "Charlie"}]
# → Extract only names.

# Flatten nested array: [1, [2, 3], [4, [5]]]

# Get the last even number in [1, 3, 4, 6, 7].

# Convert: [1, 2, 3] → {1=>"odd", 2=>"even", 3=>"odd"}

# Find the word with maximum length in ["hi", "hello", "world"].

# Get average of numbers [10, 20, 30, 40].
