🧱 What Are They?
Type  	Reusable?	   Return Behavior	                  Syntax
Block	  No	         Returns from caller                method	do...end or {}
Proc	  Yes	         Returns from calling method	      Proc.new
Lambda	Yes	         Returns from lambda itself	        -> or lambda


🎯 Let’s understand with a real-life example:
🍔 Imagine:
You go to a restaurant, and the waiter says:

🔹 Block: “Tell me once what you want to eat now.” (only temporary)

🔹 Proc: “Give me your saved favorite meal anytime.” (saved for later)

🔹 Lambda: “Give me your saved favorite meal, but if there's a mistake in the order, I’ll tell the chef — not run away!” (stricter)
