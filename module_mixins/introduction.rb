# Ruby modules provide a way to group related methods together for code reusability and namespacing. They cannot be instantiated like classes but can be included or extended in other classes.


# A mixin is when a class includes multiple modules to reuse functionality.

module Greet
  def say_hello
    "Hello from the module!"
  end
end


#  include vs extend
# include adds module methods as instance methods in a class.
# extend adds module methods as class methods in a class.




class Person
  include Greet  # Adds 'say_hello' as an instance method
end

class Robot
  extend Greet  # Adds 'say_hello' as a class method
end



person = Person.new
puts person.say_hello   # ‚úÖ Works (instance method)

# puts Robot.new.say_hello   # ‚ùå Error: NoMethodError
puts Robot.say_hello   # ‚úÖ Works (class method)


# Namespaces in Modules
# Modules help organize code and avoid name conflicts by acting as namespaces.

# Modules can act as namespaces, preventing method name conflicts.

# Example: Using a Namespace

module MathTools
  class Calculator
    def add(a, b)
      a + b
    end
  end
end

calc = MathTools::Calculator.new  # Using the namespace
puts calc.add(5, 3)  # Output: 8

# MathTools::Calculator prevents conflicts with other Calculator classes.
# This is useful when working with large projects or third-party libraries.


# Mixin Concept in Ruby
# Mixins allow multiple inheritance in Ruby (since Ruby doesn‚Äôt support multiple inheritance like C++).

# Instead of inheriting from multiple classes, we use modules as mixins.



#  Mixins allow multiple inheritance-like behavior.


# Using prepend ‚Äì Overriding Existing Methods
# The prepend method inserts a module before the class itself, meaning the module's methods override the class‚Äôs methods.

module Greetings
  def say_hello
    puts "Hello from Module!"
  end
end
class User
  prepend Greetings
  
  def say_hello
    puts "Hello from User class!"
  end
end

user = User.new
user.say_hello  # ‚úÖ Output: Hello from Module!
# üîπ prepend gives higher priority to module methods than the class‚Äôs own methods.


# A mixin is when a class includes multiple modules to reuse functionality.

module Walk
  def walk
    puts "I am walking!"
  end
end

module Talk
  def talk
    puts "I am talking!"
  end
end

class Human
  include Walk
  include Talk
end

person = Human.new
person.walk  # ‚úÖ Output: I am walking!
person.talk  # ‚úÖ Output: I am talking!
